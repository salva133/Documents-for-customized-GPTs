== Description ==
A light, rugged, and dependable design, the '''''Wolfhound''''' made its first appearance in [[Introduction Year::3028]]. Following the success of the ''[[Hatchetman]]'' designed in partnership with the [[Federated Suns]], [[Archon]] [[Katrina Steiner]] ordered [[TharHes Industries]] to produce a [[BattleMech]] to address a persistent problem of the [[Lyran Commonwealth Armed Forces]]: hunting down and destroying the ''[[Panther]]'' and ''[[Jenner]]'', swift light-weight 'Mechs of the [[Draconis Combine]] which had embarrassed the LCAF one too many times. The final design was a light 'Mech with an all-energy weapons payload effective at a variety of combat ranges, the maximum amount of armor for a 'Mech of its weight class, and the use of mostly standard components to keep costs down.<ref name=TRO3039>''Technical Readout: 3039'', p. 226-227</ref><ref name=TRO3050U>''Technical Readout: 3050 Upgrade'', p. 32-33</ref><ref name=SBSaD>''Starterbook: Sword and Dragon'', p.28</ref>

Due to their fierce loyalty to House Steiner, the [[Kell Hounds]] were the first unit chosen to field-test the ''Wolfhound'' in combat, followed shortly thereafter by [[Wolf's Dragoons]]. The design received its baptism of fire during the [[Fourth Succession War]] where it exceeded all expectations and performed brilliantly. This was especially true when the ''Wolfhound'' faced its intended targets, hitting the ''Jenner'' beyond its ability to return fire while closing the distance on the ''Panther'' to get within the minimum range of its primary weapon. With the successful end of the war the [[Federated Commonwealth]] ordered larger numbers of ''Wolfhound''s to outfit its [[Armed Forces of the Federated Commonwealth|military]] and the design was used again during the [[War of 3039]]. ''Wolfhound''s suffered far fewer casualties than other 'Mechs during that conflict and as such, a mere handful fell into the hands of the Combine. While impressed with the 'Mech, the Kuritans were too prideful to copy it themselves, instead using captured examples to help develop the ''[[Wolf Trap]]'' specifically to counter the 'Mech.<ref name=TRO3039/><ref name=TRO3050U/>

Eventually [[Arc-Royal MechWorks]] was brought in to produce ''Wolfhound''s under license from TharHes, and the recovery of [[lostech]] thanks to the [[Helm Memory Core]] allowed for a more advanced variant to be produced to combat the [[Clan Invasion]]. Unfortunately the necessary retooling of TharHes' factories to produce the WLF-2 model, introduced in [[3052]], took too long before [[ComStar]] brought an end to the invasion with the [[Battle of Tukayyid (3052)|Battle of Tukayyid]]. These newer ''Wolfhound''s continued to be produced for both FedCom member states, although following the formal creation of the [[Lyran Alliance]] the TharHes factories began producing the newer WLF-3S model. This new variant was shipped only to units loyal to the Lyran state, and thus fought on the side of [[Katherine Steiner-Davion]] during the [[FedCom Civil War]]. During the [[Jihad]] the [[Word of Blake]] launched a devastating assault on [[Tharkad]], effectively shutting down TharHes' ''Wolfhound'' factory line; in response Arc-Royal increased production and introduced the WLF-4 model to replace the losses suffered by allied forces fighting the Blakists.<ref name=TRO3050U/>

==Weapons and Equipment==
As a "laser boat", the ''Wolfhound''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s very basic weapons array frees it from supply lines and allows for superior endurance during extended campaigns. The primary long-range weapon is a [[Cyclops XII]] [[ER large laser]] mounted in the right arm, which allows the ''Wolfhound'' to strike at ranges of nearly 600 meters. As secondary weapons for close combat, the ''Wolfhound'' is armed with four [[Defiance B3M]] [[medium laser]]s, three of which are split between the right, center, and left torso, while the fourth is mounted in the center-rear in case any 'Mech tries to exploit this traditional blind spot.<ref name=TRO3039/><ref name=TRO3050U/>

10 [[double heat sink]]s allow for superior heat management, while seven and a half tons of armor provide excellent protection. While the majority of the components used in the ''Wolfhound'' are Lyran in origin, the use of a [[Full-Head Ejection System]] required the help of the Federated Suns. Countless [[MechWarrior (pilot)|MechWarrior]] lives have been saved thanks to this system's ability to operate in traditionally hostile environments.<ref name=TRO3039/><ref name=TRO3050U/>

==Description==
The '''''Timber Wolf''''' is a fast, heavy [[OmniMech]]. A signature design of the [[Clans]]' military might, it was arguably the first Clan [[OmniMech]] encountered by [[Inner Sphere]] forces (as opposed to [[periphery]] forces) on [[The Rock]] in [[3049]] by [[Phelan Kell]].<ref name=TRO3050Up136f/><ref name=TRO3050>''Technical Readout: 3050'', pp. 34–35: "Mad Cat OmniMech Profile"</ref><ref name=TRO3050R>''Technical Readout: 3050 Revised'', pp. 32–33: "Mad Cat OmniMech Profile"</ref>

Vaguely resembling a cross between the MAD (''[[Marauder]]'') and CAT (''[[Catapult]]'') series, the ''Timber Wolf'' was tagged with the Inner Sphere [[Inner Sphere Designation for Clan BattleMechs|reporting name]] '''''Mad Cat''''' on first contact. (The targeting computer on [[Phelan Kell]]'s ''Wolfhound'' switched between MAD and CAT when trying to identify it; upon analyzing the data recording from Kell's 'Mech, [[Precentor Martial of ComStar|Precentor Martial]] [[Anastasius Focht]] later officially designated it "''Mad Cat''".<ref name=TRO3050Up136f/><ref name=TRO3050/><ref name=TRO3050R/>

The ''Timber Wolf'' is vastly more powerful than either the 3025-era ''Marauder'' or ''Catapult'', and features approximately as much firepower as both of those mechs combined. It uses its speed and firepower to engage an enemy at the range of its choosing. When first encountered by Inner Sphere forces the idea that a heavy 'Mech could move so swiftly while being as heavily armed and armored as the ''Timber Wolf'' was inconceivable. With its twelve tons of [[ferro-fibrous]] armor and an arsenal that rivaled most [[:Category:Assault BattleMechs|assault 'Mechs]] of the era, it was completely alien to Inner Sphere military planners, commanders, and even the Precentor Martial of [[ComStar]].
First introduced in [[2945]], the ''Timber Wolf'' was designed by [[Clan Wolf]] as a second generation [[OmniMech]] along with the ''[[Gargoyle]]'' and the ''[[Naga (OmniMech)|Naga]]'' to replace the aging ''[[Woodsman]]''. While the ''Gargoyle'' may have been a very capable, fast assault OmniMech, and the ''Naga'' may have been an excellent fire-support OmniMech, Clan Wolf (and indeed every other Clan) instantly realized the value of the ''Timber Wolf''; thus, production rights to the ''Timber Wolf'' were jealously (and successfully) defended. Only through trade, gifts and battlefield salvage has the ''Timber Wolf'' entered the armies of other Clans. Until the [[Clan Invasion|invasion]] of the Inner Sphere, production of the ''Timber Wolf'' has been limited to a single facility on [[Strana Mechty]].<ref name=TRO3050Up136f/><ref name=TRO3050/><ref name=TRO3050R/>

==Weapons and Equipment==
The default configuration of the ''Timber Wolf'' features a well-blended mix of energy and missile weaponry; primarily extended-range lasers and long range missile racks that give the ''Timber Wolf'' considerable firepower at medium and long range. A pair of [[LRM-20]] racks supplemented by two [[Extended Range Large Laser]]s make up the bulk of the ''Timber Wolf''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s firepower. The ''Timber Wolf'' also has an array of lighter, shorter ranged weaponry for use once the [['Mech]] draws closer to its prey: two [[ER Medium Laser]]s and a [[Medium Pulse Laser]]. Finally, it has two [[Machine Guns]] for point defense against infantry. Even on the modern battlefield the primary configuration of the ''Timber Wolf'' is a force to be reckoned with.<ref name=TRO3050Up136f/><ref name=TRO3050/><ref name=TRO3050R/>

==Description==
At the higher end of the medium class, the '''''Dervish''''' is a highly mobile fire support [[BattleMech]]. Commissioned in [[Introduction Year::2520]] by the [[Lyran Commonwealth]],<ref name=JS>''Jihad Secrets: The Blake Documents'', p. 151: "DV-1S 'Primitive' ''Dervish''"</ref> the ''Dervish'' has a maximum speed of 86.4 km/h, letting it keep up with and support most [[BattleTech eras|Succession Wars]]-era medium and light models. Five [[jump jet]]s also gives the 'Mech a jumping capability of 150 meters, allowing it to move through rough terrain with ease; these were originally an afterthought in the design but have proven their worth.  While regarded by some as a poor man's ''[[Archer]]'', the ''Dervish''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s speed and weaponry nevertheless allow it to provide quick fire support and free larger 'Mechs for other duties.

The design's major flaws lie in its lack of hand actuators and in its armoring. Having no hands limits its usefulness outside of combat and restricts its capability when confronted in close quarters. As for the armor, while sufficient to handle small and medium weapons, it is inadequate against heavier firepower. Commanders cannot overcome the first issue but they can affect the second, albeit at an apparent cost of firepower. The conundrum faced here is that the tradeoff becomes counterintuitive given the 'Mech's primary role in the field.<ref name=TRO3039/><ref name=TRO3025/><ref name=TRO3025r>''Technical Readout: 3025 Revised'', p. 64</ref>

The ''Dervish'' was among the first 'Mechs mass produced by the [[Great Houses]] and has served as a workhorse for their armies since its introduction. It was eventually commissioned into the [[Star League Defense Force]] during the [[Reunification War]], with the [[Terran Hegemony]] providing funds to allow their original model ''Dervishes'' be upgraded to the DV-6M standard in [[2610]]. Its service in the SLDF ensured the widespread proliferation of the design; even [[ComStar]] [[Explorer Corps (ComStar)|Explorer Corps]] missions into the [[Deep Periphery]] have found examples of original-model ''Dervishes'' among the forces of [[Nueva Castile]]. Over the course of the Succession Wars however the 'Mech's numbers decreased due to loss or lack of parts, and all but one of Achernar's factories was destroyed. Though it could still be found throughout the [[Inner Sphere]] by the end of the [[Third Succession War]], only the [[Federated Suns]] maintained production of the venerable design.<ref name=TRO3039/><ref name=TRO3025/><ref name=TRO3025r/><ref name=TRO3050/><ref name=TRO3050r>''Technical Readout: 3050 Revised'', pp. 116–117</ref><ref name=TRO3050u>''Technical Readout: 3050 Upgrade'', p. 62</ref><ref>[http://www.masterunitlist.info/Unit/878/Dervish-DV-6M -6M MUL listing]</ref>

==Weapons and Equipment==
The ''Dervish'' carries as its main weapons two [[LRM-10#Federated_10-Shot|Federated 10-Shot]] [[LRM-10]] launchers. These missile launchers give the ''Dervish'' the long-range capability needed to provide fire support to friendly units and are safely embedded in the torso as opposed to the exposed launchers on other 'Mechs. One ton of ammunition per launcher provides sufficient endurance for any but the most prolonged battles. For close combat, the ''Dervish'' carries two [[Federated 2-Shot]] [[SRM-2]] launchers and two [[ChisComp 39]] [[medium laser]]s. The SRM launchers are completely self-contained within the forearms, allowing them to be aimed quickly, and fed by one ton of ammunition each, while the lasers are placed just above the launchers and ensure the 'Mech is still capable of fighting should it run out of missiles. The ''Dervish'' is capable of jumping 150 meters and is protected by seven and a half tons of armor.<ref name=TRO3025 /><ref name=TRO3025r /><ref name=TRO3039 /><ref name=IRS>''Introductory Record Sheets, p. 15</ref>

==Description==
The '''''Black Python''''', which was [[Inner Sphere Designation for Clan BattleMechs|designated]] the '''''Viper''''' by [[Inner Sphere]] forces, is similar in many ways to the ''[[Warhammer]]'' and ''[[Marauder]]'' [[BattleMech]]s. Though it is faster than those heavies, it has a similar weapons loadout with comparable damage, albeit with much more accurate damage potential. In order to achieve this, this expensive second-line 'Mech avails itself of all weight saving technologies that were at the disposal of the [[Clans]], including an [[XL engine]], [[Endo Steel]] frame, and eleven tons of [[ferro-fibrous]] armor. In addition to its speed, the ''Black Python'' mounts five [[jump jet]]s that propel it up to 150 meters at a time.<ref name=TRO3055p126-127>''Technical Readout: 3055'', pp. 126–127: "Viper OmniMech Profile"</ref><ref name=TRO3055Rp110-111>''Technical Readout: 3055 Revised'', pp. 110–111: "Viper OmniMech Profile"</ref>

In the thirty-second century, the [[Raven Alliance]] restarted production of the ''Black Python'', renaming it the '''''White Raven'''''. The ''White Raven'' was one of the first production BattleMechs to use [[Ferro-Lamellor]] armor.<ref>''Recognition Guide: ilClan, vol. 12'', p. 10</ref>

==Weapons and Equipment==
The paired [[Large Pulse Laser|Large]] and Lambda [[Medium Pulse Laser]]s provide highly accurate firepower at ranges that are possible to close in on thanks to the 'Mech's speed. Four Chi Series [[Small Pulse Laser]]s and two Series XIb [[Machine Gun]]s provide more firepower at close range while also able to annihilate unarmored [[infantry]] that stray too close. All of the lasers are made even more accurate by the inclusion of a [[Targeting Computer]]. Thirteen [[double heat sink]]s keep heat levels in check.<ref name=TRO3055p126-127/><ref name=TRO3055Rp110-111/>
