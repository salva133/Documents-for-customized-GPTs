==Description==
At the higher end of the medium class, the '''''Dervish''''' is a highly mobile fire support [[BattleMech]]. Commissioned in [[Introduction Year::2520]] by the [[Lyran Commonwealth]],<ref name=JS>''Jihad Secrets: The Blake Documents'', p. 151: "DV-1S 'Primitive' ''Dervish''"</ref> the ''Dervish'' has a maximum speed of 86.4 km/h, letting it keep up with and support most [[BattleTech eras|Succession Wars]]-era medium and light models. Five [[jump jet]]s also gives the 'Mech a jumping capability of 150 meters, allowing it to move through rough terrain with ease; these were originally an afterthought in the design but have proven their worth.  While regarded by some as a poor man's ''[[Archer]]'', the ''Dervish''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s speed and weaponry nevertheless allow it to provide quick fire support and free larger 'Mechs for other duties.

The design's major flaws lie in its lack of hand actuators and in its armoring. Having no hands limits its usefulness outside of combat and restricts its capability when confronted in close quarters. As for the armor, while sufficient to handle small and medium weapons, it is inadequate against heavier firepower. Commanders cannot overcome the first issue but they can affect the second, albeit at an apparent cost of firepower. The conundrum faced here is that the tradeoff becomes counterintuitive given the 'Mech's primary role in the field.<ref name=TRO3039/><ref name=TRO3025/><ref name=TRO3025r>''Technical Readout: 3025 Revised'', p. 64</ref>

The ''Dervish'' was among the first 'Mechs mass produced by the [[Great Houses]] and has served as a workhorse for their armies since its introduction. It was eventually commissioned into the [[Star League Defense Force]] during the [[Reunification War]], with the [[Terran Hegemony]] providing funds to allow their original model ''Dervishes'' be upgraded to the DV-6M standard in [[2610]]. Its service in the SLDF ensured the widespread proliferation of the design; even [[ComStar]] [[Explorer Corps (ComStar)|Explorer Corps]] missions into the [[Deep Periphery]] have found examples of original-model ''Dervishes'' among the forces of [[Nueva Castile]]. Over the course of the Succession Wars however the 'Mech's numbers decreased due to loss or lack of parts, and all but one of Achernar's factories was destroyed. Though it could still be found throughout the [[Inner Sphere]] by the end of the [[Third Succession War]], only the [[Federated Suns]] maintained production of the venerable design.<ref name=TRO3039/><ref name=TRO3025/><ref name=TRO3025r/><ref name=TRO3050/><ref name=TRO3050r>''Technical Readout: 3050 Revised'', pp. 116–117</ref><ref name=TRO3050u>''Technical Readout: 3050 Upgrade'', p. 62</ref><ref>[http://www.masterunitlist.info/Unit/878/Dervish-DV-6M -6M MUL listing]</ref>

==Weapons and Equipment==
The ''Dervish'' carries as its main weapons two [[LRM-10#Federated_10-Shot|Federated 10-Shot]] [[LRM-10]] launchers. These missile launchers give the ''Dervish'' the long-range capability needed to provide fire support to friendly units and are safely embedded in the torso as opposed to the exposed launchers on other 'Mechs. One ton of ammunition per launcher provides sufficient endurance for any but the most prolonged battles. For close combat, the ''Dervish'' carries two [[Federated 2-Shot]] [[SRM-2]] launchers and two [[ChisComp 39]] [[medium laser]]s. The SRM launchers are completely self-contained within the forearms, allowing them to be aimed quickly, and fed by one ton of ammunition each, while the lasers are placed just above the launchers and ensure the 'Mech is still capable of fighting should it run out of missiles. The ''Dervish'' is capable of jumping 150 meters and is protected by seven and a half tons of armor.<ref name=TRO3025 /><ref name=TRO3025r /><ref name=TRO3039 /><ref name=IRS>''Introductory Record Sheets, p. 15</ref>
