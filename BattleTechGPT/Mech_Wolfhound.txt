== Description ==
A light, rugged, and dependable design, the '''''Wolfhound''''' made its first appearance in [[Introduction Year::3028]]. Following the success of the ''[[Hatchetman]]'' designed in partnership with the [[Federated Suns]], [[Archon]] [[Katrina Steiner]] ordered [[TharHes Industries]] to produce a [[BattleMech]] to address a persistent problem of the [[Lyran Commonwealth Armed Forces]]: hunting down and destroying the ''[[Panther]]'' and ''[[Jenner]]'', swift light-weight 'Mechs of the [[Draconis Combine]] which had embarrassed the LCAF one too many times. The final design was a light 'Mech with an all-energy weapons payload effective at a variety of combat ranges, the maximum amount of armor for a 'Mech of its weight class, and the use of mostly standard components to keep costs down.<ref name=TRO3039>''Technical Readout: 3039'', p. 226-227</ref><ref name=TRO3050U>''Technical Readout: 3050 Upgrade'', p. 32-33</ref><ref name=SBSaD>''Starterbook: Sword and Dragon'', p.28</ref>

Due to their fierce loyalty to House Steiner, the [[Kell Hounds]] were the first unit chosen to field-test the ''Wolfhound'' in combat, followed shortly thereafter by [[Wolf's Dragoons]]. The design received its baptism of fire during the [[Fourth Succession War]] where it exceeded all expectations and performed brilliantly. This was especially true when the ''Wolfhound'' faced its intended targets, hitting the ''Jenner'' beyond its ability to return fire while closing the distance on the ''Panther'' to get within the minimum range of its primary weapon. With the successful end of the war the [[Federated Commonwealth]] ordered larger numbers of ''Wolfhound''s to outfit its [[Armed Forces of the Federated Commonwealth|military]] and the design was used again during the [[War of 3039]]. ''Wolfhound''s suffered far fewer casualties than other 'Mechs during that conflict and as such, a mere handful fell into the hands of the Combine. While impressed with the 'Mech, the Kuritans were too prideful to copy it themselves, instead using captured examples to help develop the ''[[Wolf Trap]]'' specifically to counter the 'Mech.<ref name=TRO3039/><ref name=TRO3050U/>

Eventually [[Arc-Royal MechWorks]] was brought in to produce ''Wolfhound''s under license from TharHes, and the recovery of [[lostech]] thanks to the [[Helm Memory Core]] allowed for a more advanced variant to be produced to combat the [[Clan Invasion]]. Unfortunately the necessary retooling of TharHes' factories to produce the WLF-2 model, introduced in [[3052]], took too long before [[ComStar]] brought an end to the invasion with the [[Battle of Tukayyid (3052)|Battle of Tukayyid]]. These newer ''Wolfhound''s continued to be produced for both FedCom member states, although following the formal creation of the [[Lyran Alliance]] the TharHes factories began producing the newer WLF-3S model. This new variant was shipped only to units loyal to the Lyran state, and thus fought on the side of [[Katherine Steiner-Davion]] during the [[FedCom Civil War]]. During the [[Jihad]] the [[Word of Blake]] launched a devastating assault on [[Tharkad]], effectively shutting down TharHes' ''Wolfhound'' factory line; in response Arc-Royal increased production and introduced the WLF-4 model to replace the losses suffered by allied forces fighting the Blakists.<ref name=TRO3050U/>

==Weapons and Equipment==
As a "laser boat", the ''Wolfhound''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s very basic weapons array frees it from supply lines and allows for superior endurance during extended campaigns. The primary long-range weapon is a [[Cyclops XII]] [[ER large laser]] mounted in the right arm, which allows the ''Wolfhound'' to strike at ranges of nearly 600 meters. As secondary weapons for close combat, the ''Wolfhound'' is armed with four [[Defiance B3M]] [[medium laser]]s, three of which are split between the right, center, and left torso, while the fourth is mounted in the center-rear in case any 'Mech tries to exploit this traditional blind spot.<ref name=TRO3039/><ref name=TRO3050U/>

10 [[double heat sink]]s allow for superior heat management, while seven and a half tons of armor provide excellent protection. While the majority of the components used in the ''Wolfhound'' are Lyran in origin, the use of a [[Full-Head Ejection System]] required the help of the Federated Suns. Countless [[MechWarrior (pilot)|MechWarrior]] lives have been saved thanks to this system's ability to operate in traditionally hostile environments.<ref name=TRO3039/><ref name=TRO3050U/>
