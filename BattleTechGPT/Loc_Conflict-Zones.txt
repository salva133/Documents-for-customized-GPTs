The Taurian Concordat lives in constant fear of an imminent Federated Suns invasion, where in reality the Federated Suns can spare little time or even interest for that nation. The Capellan Confederation, always looking to relieve tensions on its border, is not above provoking conflict between the two other parties as a distraction, resulting in frequent conflict and highly lucrative opportunities for mercenaries in the region.
